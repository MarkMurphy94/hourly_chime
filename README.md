# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is a simple React Native mobile application to create an hourly chime like old clocks used to. For the life of me, I have not been able to find a simple way to do this on my phone aside from setting an alarm that I need to manually dismiss. I have also not found 
any existing applications that do this and *only* this. 

The app will send a simple notification with a reminder of the time, on the hour. You can choose which hours it will send this notitification. 

As someone with ADHD, I often find myself losing hours if I am engaged in an activity or project. I've found it helpful to have a periodic, passive reminder of the time passing.

I am 99% sure this app will *not* work on iOS at this point. I have only tested it on an Android device, and I am aware of several iOS components it is missing. 

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
